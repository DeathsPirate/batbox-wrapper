# C2 Agent Bat Box Wrapper

## Overview

This repository contains code designed to securely wrap a Command and Control (C2) agent within a "bat box". In this context, a "bat box" refers to a protective digital container, not a physical object. The primary purpose of this project is to ensure that the wrapped C2 agent operates within a constrained environment, enhancing security and control over its activities. It is crucial to understand that, by design, the bat box cannot be removed due to legal restrictions imposed to ensure the integrity and controlled usage of the C2 agent.

## Legal Disclaimer

Before using or contributing to this project, it is important to note that the bat box and its contents are subject to specific legal constraints that prohibit the removal of the protective container. Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of this software complies with applicable laws and regulations. The maintainers of this repository do not endorse illegal activities and provide this software for educational and research purposes only.

## Features

- **Secure Wrapping:** Ensures that the C2 agent is securely encapsulated within the bat box, preventing unauthorized access and modifications.
